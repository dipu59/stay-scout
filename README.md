# StayScout 
**Discover stays. Travel smarter.**

After 2+ weeks of hard work, learning, debugging, and iterating,
I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve completed building a Restaurant Feedback Website from scratch.


StayScout is a modern travel discovery web application where users can explore top-rated restaurants, hotels, and places with a clean UI, smooth interactions, and performance-focused architecture.

This project was more than just UI design — my primary goal was to create a real-world, scalable frontend architecture.
